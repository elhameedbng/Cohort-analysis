# Cohort-analysis
Cohort analysis involves dividing users into distinct groups, or cohorts, based on certain criteria. In this case study, these cohorts are defined by the time of user acquisition. By grouping users together based on time of acquisition, we can study how different cohorts behave in terms of engagement and retention.

For example, you might create cohorts based on the month users first signed up for your service. You can then track how each cohort's activity, such as their conversion rate or lifetime value, evolves over time. This approach allows you to identify trends, anomalies, and areas where you may need to make adjustments to improve user retention and satisfaction.
